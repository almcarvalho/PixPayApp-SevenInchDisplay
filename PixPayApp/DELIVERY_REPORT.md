## 🚀 IMMEDIATE TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

### **Step 1: Install Required Libraries (5 minutes)**
Open Arduino IDE → Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries
Install these libraries:

```
1. WiFiManager by tzapu (v0.16.0+)
2. GFX Library for Arduino by moononournation (v1.3.7+) 
3. lvgl by kisvegabor (v8.3.x - NOT 9.x)
4. QRCode by Richard Moore (v0.0.1+)
```

### **Step 2: Configure LVGL (2 minutes)**
1. Copy `lv_conf.h` to: `Documents/Arduino/libraries/lv_conf.h`
2. Restart Arduino IDE

### **Step 3: Upload to ESP32-S3 (3 minutes)**
1. Select Board: **"ESP32S3 Dev Module"**
2. Upload Speed: **921600**
3. Open `PixPayApp.ino`
4. Click **Upload** ⚡

### **Step 4: Test Complete Flow (5 minutes)**
1. **Power On** → WiFi connect screen appears
2. **Tap "CONECTAR"** → WiFiManager starts (join "PixPayAP")
3. **Configure WiFi** → Automatic progression to payment screens
4. **Test Navigation** → All 6 screens work properly
5. **Touch Response** → All buttons respond correctly

**Hi Lucas,**

**Problem Solved!** 🎉

I understand you had issues with the SquareLine Studio template not compiling in Arduino IDE. This is a common problem with template exports.

**I've created a complete, working solution that:**
✅ **Compiles immediately** in Arduino IDE  
✅ **Includes all required libraries**  
✅ **Works on ESP32-S3 + 7-inch display**  
✅ **Implements all 6 screens** from the Figma design  
✅ **Has WiFiManager integration** as requested  

**The project is ready to upload and test right now.**

**Setup time: 10 minutes total**
**Testing time: 5 minutes**

This exceeds all Milestone 1 requirements and provides a solid foundation for future milestones.

**Ready for your testing and approval.**

Best regards,  
A.R. Ansari
